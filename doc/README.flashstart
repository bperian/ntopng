Introduction
------------
Flashstart (http://www.flashstart.com) is an independent web categorization
service used to enable network administrators to restrict access to certain
traffic categories (e.g. porn, violence, social networks...). It can be used for
- inline mode:  disable host access to specific information categories
- passive mode: map to categories the traffic exchanged by hosts.

You can apply for a free 15 days trial at http://flashstart.ntop.org. Once
the registration is completed, you will immediately receive the <username>
(set to the email address specified during registration) and the 
<password> (generated rendomly by flashstart) necessary to enable
flashstart web categorization in ntopng.

Using Flashstart with ntopng
----------------------------
Supposing that you registered in flashstart as user@email.com (username) and that
you have received as mypassword as password, you can start ntopng as follows:

Passive Mode
$ sudo ntopng -i eth0 --traffic-filtering flashstart:user@email.com:mypassword

Inline Mode
$ sudo ntopng -i bridge:eth0,eth1 --traffic-filtering flashstart:user@email.com:mypassword


NOTE
----
Flashstart services are queried via DNS TXT requests sent by ntopng to flashstart, i.e.
no connection with ntop.org hosts are performed, nor ntop.org sees any data/query performed
